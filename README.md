# Shellcode
Contains collection of shellcodes and shellcode generating programs or scripts written by me 

Shellcode is basically a code, that is injected in a vulnerable running process to spawn a shell. Shellcodes are often self-contained, means it is executable on its own and does not need any other segments.The shellcode bytes are actually architecture-specific machine instructions, so shellcode is written using the assembly language.
